## Project Rundown
Let's HangÂ© is a dynamic site that brings to life the paper-and-pen game of hangman! Users have the opportunity to create their own games, play games created by other users, and compete for the top spot on the coveted leaderboard. Games award coins which can be used to purchase cool, upgraded avatars, incentivising continued gameplay. Users also have access to a chat feature to talk with fellow players between games. The main features of the site include:

. Login/register options to create an account, supported by a profile page detailing the user's personal stats such as the number of games they've created, their total number of games solved, and their favourite category to play.

. A feed page complete with chat pop-up that can be perused for games. Users can play as much as they want - as long as they are not the game creator and haven't played the game before. Users can also view the past plays for each game to see how other users did.

. A create page to make your own games by choosing a category, setting a word/phrase to be guessed, setting a time limit, and including a caption to be displayed on the feed (optional). Users post games which immediately go live on the feed.

. Games lead to a hangman page which presents gameplay in a fun, animated environment. Users must beat the clock to solve the word in order to win 10 coins.

. Coins can be spent freely in the site shop which offers customisations for users' avatars. Users' avatars will show in the feed above games they create.

. The leaderboard page keeps track of site-wide activity and ranks users by their numbers of successes as they vie for a top-20 spot.
  
## Instructions to run: 
The following python code should be run in the terminal to set up the database:

py // establishes python terminal
from application.models import db, Item, User, Game, Message, UserGames
from application import app
with app.app_context():
    db.drop_all()
    db.create_all()

Then the following can be run to launch the app in the Flask environment:

py run.py

Users and posts can then be created via the website using register/login. The chat is fully interactive and can be examined simultaneously from separate ports.
