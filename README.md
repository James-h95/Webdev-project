_The General main idea:_
- Main idea is the game TIC-TAC-TOE or TTT (logic will be implemented via javascript)
- Real time PVP games which includes a live chat.
- Misere tic tac toe - basically TTT but reversed. Could implement a chance every round or so often where the mode of game chosen randomly: can switch from OG ttt to MISERE ttt each round (Random % to switch modes maybe between 5% - 30%)
- All games will start in Misere mode though
- Navbar contains: Home,play, how to play, stats/ranking, Market (Buy and customise their Xs and Os?), Profile (Or instead of text could just be the image they have set as their profile, which can be changed. Maybe their stats will also be included here?)

_Sub ideas:_
- Players able to wager/bet on chances of the game changing modes (if they have sufficient money)
    - For example, Can bet that game will stay Misere whole time (x1.3 multiplier)
    - or that game will switch modes to OG ttt (x2.8 mulltiplier).
    - BUT users can only receive their bet winnings if they win the game
 
- In-game currency. Each win get money.
- Should we impose limits or not on the live chat
- Their will be a shop with customisations etc (Just for aesthetic?) they can buy with in-game currency
- Ranking system? With each win get rank points? Certain rank points will make ur name appear in dif colours? (to signify ur level)  Or to make simple,
  could make each profile have a line in bottom half signifying colour of their ranking?
